AuroraGraphAlgo
===============

AuroraGraphAlgo is a collection of graph algorithms based on my AuroraGraphManager graph data structure
implementation. This project is a Java 8 implementation of some algorithms implemented in my MS Thesis
(which was about community detection in graphs).

Parallel Graph algorithms (Pregel like implementation)
<ul>
	<li>PageRank</li>
	<li>Label Propagation (Community Detection)</li>
	<li>Connected Components</li>
</ul>

Other
<ul>
	<li>Dijkstra Shortest Path (not very scalable)</li>
</ul>

In progress
<ul>
	<li>Louvain Method</li>
	<li>Link Prediction?</li>
</ul>
